To display, create, and modify Products list:

**1) Ensure to select the following fields (required). Optionally, select "Status" field as well. By default, only the Active products are displayed. Including the "Status" field will allow you to use the filter to view Active, Draft, ... products.**

**2) Ensure to add default values for the above selected fields. For "Unit Group" and "Default Unit", I use a dummy Unit Group and it's default Unit. You will be able to change these values once the product is created.**

**3) Set grid options**
